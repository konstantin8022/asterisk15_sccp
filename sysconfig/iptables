# Sangoma base configuration for iptables service. 
#
# Release 3 - 2018-01-30
#
# This file will AUTOMATICALLY be upgraded with newer releases
# of sangoma-pbx. The default RHEL7 iptables firwall is saved in
# the current directory as 'iptables.default'. Note that this is
# NOT SUITABLE for a SIP Phone system, and will be disabled as
# part of PBX Startup and Shutdown.
#
# If you wish to change this file and ensure that it's not over-
# written, change the next line to say '# AUTOUPDATE-BLOCK'
# instead of '# AUTOUPDATE-OK'.  
#
# AUTOUPDATE-OK
